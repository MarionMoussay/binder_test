<exercise id="2" title="Introducing the **sensochoc** dataset">

1. Please notice that for this tutorial, you are in a controlled environment and everything has been downloaded for you, the datasets and the different packages you need ; the packages have been installed as well. Remember, the first thing you have to think of, before analysing your data, is the different packages you might need. For this tutorial, we will use the _SensoMineR_ package. This package is a very useful package as it can analyse many different types of sensory data, from QDA to holistic approaches such as sorting or napping data. In a real life situation you would have to import the dataset, and to install and load the packages. To install, then load a package, you can refer to the code below.
